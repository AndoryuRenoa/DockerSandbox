# MavenFrontendSandbox

Current method for spring/angular apps that deploy from a single runnable fat jar (using the maven-front end multi module method) creates a cumbersome file structure that is difficult to change due to the large number of files involved. This repo is just a place to experiment with and ultimately keep a more ideal file structure and their corresponding pom.xml files.
